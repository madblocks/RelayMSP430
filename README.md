# RelayMSP430

In this repository, I'd be talking about how to interface a Zero Watt Bulb with MSP430 Launchpad. 

TI MSP430 Launchpad is a low-power MCU from Texas Instruments and operates on 3.3V DC. Zero Watt Bulb is operating on 230V AC, and hence you can't connect with MSP430 Launchpad directly. Thereby, a component called Relay has to be interfaced in b/n the Zero Watt Bulb and TI MSP430 Launchpad.

Relay is an Electro-Magnetic Switch which switches AC when it is triggered by MSP430 Launchpad.
